## 🛠️ Tech Stack

This project is built with simplicity, extensibility, and contribution in mind.

| Layer        | Tech Stack                                 |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Backend      | Django (Python)                            |
| Database     | SQLite for MVP → PostgreSQL                |
| Frontend     | Django Templates                           |
| File Storage | Local file storage for MVP → Cloud storage |
| Deployment   | _To be determined_                         |

### Database Notes
- Start with **SQLite** for simple MVP development.
- Upgrade to **PostgreSQL** when scaling, or for better multi-user support, indexing, and performance.

### File Storage Notes
- MVP uses **local file storage** (Django `MEDIA_ROOT`) for images and PDFs.
- Upgrade to **cloud storage (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage)** for scalability, reliability, and remote access to media.
