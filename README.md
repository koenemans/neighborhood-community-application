# 🏡 Neighborhood Community Web Application

A web-based platform designed to help neighborhood communities share news, activities, and events in one centralized space. This application aims to improve communication between residents and local committees while building a stronger sense of community.

## 📌 Purpose of the Application

This project aims to create a centralized, easy-to-use web application designed specifically for our neighborhood community. The platform will serve as an information hub where all residents can stay informed about local news and upcoming activities. It will also act as a communication channel for the various neighborhood committees.

## ✨ Key Features

### 1. Public Community Page
A publicly accessible area that displays:
- News updates from various neighborhood committees
- Announcements about upcoming events and activities hosted by various neighborhood committees
- Posters, flyers (PDFs), event photos and public documents

### 2. Content Management Portal (Admin Area)
A secure area for committee members to:
- Create and publish news posts
- Announce and manage activities
- Upload files

The idea is to use builtin Django Groups (committees) and Users (committee members).

### 3. Targeted Content
Posts are created by committee (e.g., adult, children, sports) to help residents find relevant content.

### 4. Linked News and Activities
News articles can be linked to specific activity announcements to create a connected experience for users.

### 5. Upload Functionality
Committees can upload:
- Event photos
- Flyers or posters (PDF format)
- Public documents presented by the board

### 6. Archive Access
An archive view allows users to:
- Browse content organized by **year month and committee**
- Access past news and event history

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

This project is built with simplicity, extensibility, and contribution in mind.

| Layer        | Tech Stack                                 |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Backend      | Django (Python)                            |
| Database     | SQLite for MVP → PostgreSQL                |
| Frontend     | Django Templates                           |
| File Storage | Local file storage for MVP → Cloud storage |
| Deployment   | _To be determined_                         |

### Database Notes
- Start with **SQLite** for simple MVP development.
- Upgrade to **PostgreSQL** when scaling, or for better multi-user support, indexing, and performance.

### File Storage Notes
- MVP uses **local file storage** (Django `MEDIA_ROOT`) for images and PDFs.
- Upgrade to **cloud storage (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage)** for scalability, reliability, and remote access to media.
